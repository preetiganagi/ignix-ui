## **Variants**

### **1. `default`**

A spinning circular loader using border animation.

- The top border is transparent to create a visual spinning effect.
- Controlled via `size`, `thickness`, and `color`.

### **2. `bars`**

A circular spinner made of 8 bars that fade in and out in sequence.

- Bars are rotated around the center.
- Opacity animation gives a spinning illusion.
- Uses `Framer Motion` for animations.

### **3. `dots-bounce`**

A sequential bouncing animation of four dots.

- Each dot scales and fades in a staggered sequence.
- Good for typing or waiting indicators.
- `thickness` defines the dot size.

## **Usage**

Here is an example of how to use the `Spinner` component:

```tsx
<Spinner />

<Spinner color="border-blue-500" />
<Spinner size={60} thickness={6} />
<Spinner variant="dots-bounce" thickness={10} color="red" />



---
## **Notes**

* `color` acts differently depending on the variant:

    * `default`: used as a Tailwind border color class (e.g., `border-red-500`).

    * `bars`: also Tailwind class (e.g., `bg-gray-400`).

    * `dots-bounce`: treated as a raw color string (e.g., `#10b981`).

## **Dependencies**

* `Framer Motion`

* `Tailwind CSS`

* Utility function `cn()` for conditional class merging.
